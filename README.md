## ABOUT ME
Hello and welcome to my data science portfolio. I am Antony Dudnikov, a passionate data scientist with a strong background in Statistics and Economics. Recently, I graduated from the prestigious University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor in Science degree, where I pursued a Double Major in the disciplines mentioned before. This interdisciplinary education has equipped me with a unique blend of analytical and economic insights that I bring to my data science projects.

With over 4 years of coding experience in Python and R, I have honed my programming skills to explore my fascination with data science and strengthen my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights. From data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to model creation, validation, testing and prediction, I find joy in the entire data lifecycle. 

I am open to new oppurtunites in Data Scientist roles in Toronto, Canada! Please feel free to reach out to me via email if you think I would be a great addition to your team! I'd be happy to hop on a video or phone call to talk about my projects on this portfolio. I am also open to freelance data science work! Please also send me a message and request, and we can set up a meeting on the prospective projects.
